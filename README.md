## Data Analysis with Python Certification

The goal of the Data Analysis with Python Certification is to learn how to read data from sources such as CSVs and SQL, and how to use libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to process and visiualize data.  I will be completing 5 different projects to satisfy the requirements of the certification.

### Project 1: Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator
  The assignment is to create a function (calculate()) in mean_var_std.py that uses the Numpy library to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a given 3x3 matrix.  See the readme in the corresponding folder for more information.
  

### Project 2: Demographic Data Analyzer
  This challenge is to analyze demographic data from the 1994 census database using the Pandas library.  See the folder for more information.


### Project 3: Medical Data Visualizer
  The purpose of this project was to learn how to make calculations from medical data imported from a .csv file.  Matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas were used to work with the dataset values.
  
 
### Project 4: Page View Time Series Visualizer
  The purpose of this project was to become familiar with creating different types of plots from the pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries.  These plots include line charts, bar charts, and box plots.  The data visualizations created from the given data set will help understand the patterns in page visits and identify growth.
  
 
### Project 5: Sea Level Predictor
  The purpose of this project was to use linear regression and line plots to predict the rise in sea level out to the year 2050.
